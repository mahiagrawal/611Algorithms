\section{Solution to Question 2}

\textbf{Part 1:}

\textbf{Algorithm}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Run the given algorithm $k$ number of times. $(k = 250)$
	\item Return the most frequent output in these k runs.
\end{enumerate}
To determine the minimum $k$ so that the correct answer is the most frequent output after k runs, consider the following:

The given algorithm gives correct answer with $P = 2/3$ and one of the $n$ other incorrect answers with $P = 1/3$.
Since nothing is specified for the probability distribution of incorrect answers, we will find the minimum number of trials needed for the worst case possible. 

\noindent {\bf Claim 1:} The minimum number of trials($k$) to get the correct answer most number of times will be maximum when the probability distribution of incorrect answers is such that the algorithm always returns one specific wrong answer whenever it returns
the incorrect answer.

\textbf{Please Note} that the worst case here is on the number of trials(k) required.

\begin{proof}
	In $k$ runs, if the correct answer is returned $k/2+1$ number of times, then regardless of the probability distribution of incorrect answers, we will always get correct answer as the mode (and final output). Thus, the worst case would be when the correct answer is returned $k/2$ times but it still was not the mode. This can only happen when one particular incorrect answer appeared exactly $k/2$ number of times. \newline
	Thus, the above claim holds true.
\end{proof}
Hence, the worst case on number of trials required is when the algorithm returns the correct answer with $P = 2/3$ while it returns a specific incorrect answer(let's say $x$) with $P = 1/3$. \newline
So to find minimum $k$ for worst case, the probability distribution of the given algorithm is binomial.

Taking analogy to the coin toss problem where heads can occur with probability p, the expected number of times we get incorrect answer
in k trials, $E(X) = k/3$, where $X$ is the random variable on number of times we see incorrect answer.

Consider the following random variable: \\
$X_i = \left \{
\begin{tabular}{cc}
1 & when algorithm returns incorrect answer i number of times \\
0 & otherwise
\end{tabular}
\right \}$ \\
So $X_1, X_2,.....,X_k$ are independent boolean random variables such that \\
for $X = \sum_{i} X_i$, $\mu = E[X] = k/3$ \\
Using chernoff bounds: \\
$P[X \geq (1+\delta)\mu] \leq e^{-\delta^2 \mu/3}$ \\
Substituting $\delta = 1/2$ and the value of $\mu$ \\
$P[X \geq k/2] \leq e^{-k/36}$ \\
$1 - P[X < k/2] \leq e^{-k/36}$ \\
$P[X < k/2] \geq 1 - e^{-k/36}$ \\
Now, $P(success) = P($we get the incorrect answer less than half times in k runs$)$ \\
$\Rightarrow P(success) = P(X < k/2)$ \\
$\Rightarrow P(success) \geq 1 - e^{-k/36} \geq 0.999$ \\
$\Rightarrow k > 36ln(1000)$ \\
So, minimum number of runs needed, $k = 250$

\textbf{Part 2:} When n is very large and each incorrect answer is equally likely.

\section{Solution to Question 3}



\section{Solution to Question 4}

\textbf{First Method:}

Consider $h(a) - h(b) = [f_a(r) - f_b(r)]$ mod $p$ \\
If $a \neq b$ but, $h(a) - h(b) = 0$ then the algorithm will return false negative(incorrect result). Thus, we will try to determine
the probability that algorithm fails $i.e.$ it returns false negative.

Now, consider $h(a) - h(b) = [\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (a_i-b_i) x^i]$ mod $p$ under following assumption: \\
\textbf{Assumption 1:} p  is very large such that the maximum value of $h(a) - h(b)$ is less than p.\\
\\
Under the above assumption, if $ a \neq b$ and $h(a) - h(b) = [f_a(r) - f_b(r)]$ mod $p= 0$, it is only possible when
$f_a(r) - f_b(r) = 0$ since p is a prime number. \\
$i.e.$ $(a_{n-1} - b_{n-1}) x^{n-1} + (a_{n-2} - b_{n-2}) x^{n-2} + ......+ (a_0 - b_0)1 = 0$ \\
The maximum degree of this polynomial is $n-1$, when $a_{n-1} \neq b_{n-1}$.\\
Thus this polynomial can have at most $n-1$ number of roots. \\
Using Schwartz-Zippel algorithm, for any $r$ chosen randomly from a set of t values $(1,2,3,......,t)$ \\
$P(h(a) - h(b) = 0$ when $a \neq b) \leq (n-1)/t$ \\
$P(h(a) \neq h(b) \mid a \neq b) = 1 - P(h(a) = h(b) \mid a \neq b)$ \\
$P(h(a) \neq h(b) \mid a \neq b) \geq 1- (n-1)/t  \geq 1 - 1/n$ \\
Hence, smallest possible values of $t = n(n-1)$ \\

The above t is only true when p is very large(from assumption 1). Now, let's determine the smallest possible value for p.\\
The maximum possible value of $f_a(r) - f_b(r) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (a_i-b_i) r^i$ is when each $a_i - b_i$ is maximum positive and
$r$ is maximum. \\
Since, $a$ and $b = (0,1,2...,m-1)$, the maximum value of $a_i - b_i = m-1$ when $a = m-1$ and $b= 0$.\\
Also, the maximum possible value for $r = (1,2,3,......,t)$ is $t = n(n-1)$. \\
Thus, the maximum possible value for  $f_a(r) - f_b(r) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (m-1)(t^i)$ where $t = n(n-1)$.\\
$ = (m-1)(t^n - 1)/(t-1)$ \\
So, the smallest value of p should be the first prime number greater than\\ $(m-1)(({n(n-1))}^n - 1)/(n(n-1)-1)$.

\textbf{Claim 1:} These are the smallest possible values for both t and p. 
\begin{proof}
	\textbf{Case 1:} If t is smaller than the above value, let us suppose $t = (n-1)(n-1)$, then using Schwartz-Zippel theorem \\
	$P(h(a) = h(b)$ when $a \neq b) \leq (n-1)/((n-1)(n-1))$ \\
	$\Rightarrow P(h(a) \neq h(b) \mid a \neq b) \geq 1 - 1/(n-1)$  which is less than the required probability $1 - 1/n$ \\
	\textbf{Case 2:} If p is smaller than the above value, then there is a possibility that for some value of r 
	$f_a(r) - f_b(r) = p$ and thus $h(a) - h(b) = 0$ since p mod p $= 0$\\
	$i.e. f_a(r) - f_b(r) - p = 0$ which is again a polynomial of degree at most $n-1$. Using Schwartz-Zippel, \\
	$P(h(a) = h(b)$ when $a \neq b) = P(f_a(r) - f_b(r) = 0 \mid a \neq b) + P(f_a(r) - f_b(r) = p \mid a \neq b)) \leq 2(n-1)/t$
	$\Rightarrow P(h(a) \neq h(b) \mid a \neq b) \geq 1 - 2(n-1)/t \geq 1 - 1/n$ \\
	Thus, $t = 2n(n-1)$ which is more than  the smallest determined value $n(n-1)$ which we do not want. \\
	Hence the above claim is valid.
\end{proof}

\textbf{Second Method:}
