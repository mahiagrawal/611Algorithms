Remember to put each sentence on a new line; LaTeX won't care, but github will give us fewer merge conflicts.

Some useful links for getting help with LaTeX:

- Great wiki with pretty much every command you'll ever need to know: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX
- If you don't know the command for a symbol, you can draw it in here: http://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html
- Also, most editors have a LaTeX package that provides some good IDE features.
